1. I usually use my korean name when i go to other places, but on the very first day of Dojo, as we did the name game, I thought it was too much work to correct every single person's pronunciation (people usually struggle correctly pronouncing my korean name), so I came up with an american name on that day. Since then, I'm sarah.
2. It takes an hour and a half for me to get ready everyday.
3. My favorite tea brand is TWG.
