#About Me

I'm a step-dad to a 10 year old, Max.

I married my high school sweetheart - 25 years after graduating and moving away. 

I recently purchased a Jeep 2005 Wrangler and promptly tore up the rear differential taking it off road. It'll only cost about $4k to replace, so I had better study and get a good job.
