I'm Alex Villacres and I'm from a small town in Central California called Pacific Grove! I'm 19 years old and I enjoy playing sports like soccer, lacrosse. I also enjoy relaxing at home and watching Netflix or playing Overwatch.

I decided to take a year between high school and college and decided to pursue a career in tech, which is where I was introduced to programming. One of my main goals in life is to be able to work on-the-go to allow me to travel and make side money if I were to go to school.

Looking forward to learning Python!
